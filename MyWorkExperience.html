  		<h4><b>Perbadanan Perpustakaan Awam Kelantan (PPAK)</b></h4>
  		<p>The two-month internship at Perbadanan Perpustakaan Awam Kelantan represents an exceptional opportunity for me. I am fortunate to be a member of the PPAK family, as I have had the opportunity to participate in significant events, such as the annual 'Hari Iqra dan Pesta Buku Darul Naim.' This experience has broadened my understanding of a genuine working environment. Additionally, I am receiving an opportunity to work across nearly all departments of the PPAK company.</p>

  		<p>Becoming a part-time worker has really aided me in getting experience and earning extra money for my pocket money while studying. It's a great experience for me to balance my studies and job, and it's helped me develop more discipline. Aside from that, part-time job has given me a lot of experience in dealing with customers, having conversations with them, and being organised and disciplined while working. Becoming an assistant barista and cashier was a tough and memorable experience for me. Experiencing this in my twenties has taught me a lot about the importance of money and my own hard work.</p>
